## Hello!
I’m a [Human-Computer Interaction](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/human-computer-interaction) researcher, User Experience Lead, and keynote speaker. Currently employed as a Staff UX Researcher at Google, my work is focused on developer experience, specifically for [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/), a multi-platform UI toolkit.

I received my PhD from the [School of Information](http://www.si.umich.edu) at the [University of Michigan](http://www.umich.edu). My PhD thesis is entitled [Designing Reflective User Experience with Social and Ubiquitous Computing Technologies](http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/handle/2027.42/111448). I was co-advised by [Prof. Mark Ackerman](https://www.si.umich.edu/people/mark-ackerman) and [Prof. Mark W. Newman](https://www.si.umich.edu/people/mark-newman).

### API Usability

The usability of API can make or break a developer's productivity. At DevXcon 2018, I talked about how to apply UX principles and methods to API usability ([Transcript](https://devrel.net/developer-experience/how-to-apply-ux-principles-and-methods-to-api-usability),

### Presentation of Error Messages

Programmatic errors are often difficult to resolve due to poor usability of error messages.
Applying theories of visual perception and techniques in visual design, we were able to substantially improve both error comprehension and resolution in an experiment.

### Interactive Coding Tutorials

We set out to develop a pattern language for designing interactive coding tutorials through a user-centered design process. We created and evolved three instructional patterns and their supporting interaction components and [launched an interactive tutorial](https://dart.dev/codelabs/async-await) about Dart asynchronous programming.

### Multi-device Experiences – A Design Ideation Toolkit

How do devices take on different roles in ad-hoc multi-device configurations, and how do changes in the user's context influence device roles and privacy considerations? This kit helps designers incorporate these considerations into product design.
