## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Iâ€™m a Human-Computer Interaction researcher, User Experience Lead, and keynote speaker. My current focus is applying AI to the full lifecycle of software engineering. Previously, I founded and led the UX team for Google's programming frameworks and languages group, including beloved open-source projects such as [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/), [Dart](https://dart.dev/), and [Go](https://go.dev/).

I received my PhD from the [School of Information](http://www.si.umich.edu) at the University of Michigan in 2015. 
For my [doctoral research](http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/handle/2027.42/111448), I conducted ethnographic studies, designed and prototyped systems, and ran field trials of ubiquitous computing technologies. I was co-advised by [Prof. Mark Ackerman](https://www.si.umich.edu/people/mark-ackerman) and [Prof. Mark Newman](https://www.si.umich.edu/people/mark-newman).

### API Usability

The usability of API can make or break a developer's productivity. At DevXcon 2018, I talked about how to apply UX principles and methods to API usability. Learn more: [Transcript](https://devrel.net/developer-experience/how-to-apply-ux-principles-and-methods-to-api-usability),

### Presentation of Error Messages

Programmatic errors are often difficult to resolve due to poor usability of error messages.
Applying theories of visual perception and techniques in visual design, we were able to substantially improve both error comprehension and resolution in an experiment.

### Interactive Coding Tutorials

We set out to develop a pattern language for designing interactive coding tutorials through a user-centered design process. We created and evolved three instructional patterns and their supporting interaction components and [launched an interactive tutorial](https://dart.dev/codelabs/async-await) about Dart asynchronous programming.

### Evaluating a Design System at Scale
Material Design is a Design System introduced by Google in 2014, but did it help elevating the UX of apps in the Android ecosystem? We analyzed thousands of Android apps using machine learning and computer vision techniques and found that use of Material Design was positively correlated with high app ratings and large numbers of app installs.

### Multi-device Experiences â€“ A Design Ideation Toolkit

How do devices take on different roles in ad-hoc multi-device configurations, and how do changes in the user's context influence device roles and privacy considerations? This kit helps designers incorporate these considerations into product design.
