## Hello!

I am a researcher in [Human-Computer Interaction](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/human-computer-interaction). Currently employed as a User Experience Researcher at Google, my work is focused on API usability and programming tools, specifically for [Flutter](https://flutter.io/), an opensource UI framework.

I received my PhD from the [School of Information](http://www.si.umich.edu) at the [University of Michigan](http://www.umich.edu). My PhD thesis is entitled [Designing Reflective User Experience with Social and Ubiquitous Computing Technologies](http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/handle/2027.42/111448). In graduate school, I was co-advised by [Prof. Mark Ackerman](https://www.si.umich.edu/people/mark-ackerman) and [Prof. Mark W. Newman](https://www.si.umich.edu/people/mark-newman).

### API Usability ###
The usability of API can makes or breaks the developer's productivity. At DevXcon 2018, I talked about how to apply UX principles and methods to API usability ([Transcript](https://devrel.net/developer-experience/how-to-apply-ux-principles-and-methods-to-api-usability)).

### The Moving Context Kit (McKit)
How do devices take on different roles in ad-hoc multi-device configurations, and how do changes in the user's context influence device roles and privacy considerations? This kit helps designers incorporate these considerations into product design. Learn more at [sites.google.com/corp/view/mckit](https://sites.google.com/corp/view/mckit).
